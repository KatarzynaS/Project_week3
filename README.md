Week 3 project submission 

The data set UCI HAR were downloaded from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip and unzipped
The original data description can be examined from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.

The  run_analysis.r file contains all steps taken to create a tidy data set and independent tidy dataset specified in the project description.  
Action take to create the tidy date set can be summarized as fallow:

1.	Merging the training and the test sets in order to create one data set
2.	Extracting  the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
3.	Using descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4.	Labelling the data set with descriptive activity names
5.	Creating second independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
In the CodeBook.md file can be found variables of the tidy dataset as well as transformation description.
